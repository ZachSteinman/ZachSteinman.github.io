## Websites I recommend
 * [Google] (https://www.google.com) is the obvious go to for researching information as it has access to all sorts of information and with the new ai overview feature when googling it can effectively get you answers immediately.
 * [Wikipedia] (https://www.wikipedia.org) This website is good with a vast amount of detailed information but you obviously have to check and make sure the content you are reading is verified and true.
